By Al Sweigart but re-created by Caroline Sanicola and modified by me.

I'm thinking of a {}-digit code with no repeated digits.
Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:
When I say:    That means:
  Almost       One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  Yes         One digit is correct and in the right position.
  Nope         No digit is correct.

For example, if the secret number was L48 and your guess was 84M, the
clues would be Yes Almost.'''.format(NUM_DIGITS))
